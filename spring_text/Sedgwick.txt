Spring break is a time to relax, unwind and forget about the stresses of everyday life. However, for me, this spring break was anything but relaxing. My fiancé and I decided to spend our spring break in Ojai, California, searching for our dream home and planning our upcoming wedding in October.
Our journey began on a warm Monday morning, as we drove along the Pacific Coast Highway, admiring the breathtaking views of the ocean. The drive from Los Angeles to
Ojai was just over an hour, and we couldn't wait to start house hunting in this charming little town nestled in the mountains.
As we arrived in Ojai, we were greeted by the stunning scenery of the Topatopa
Mountains, the citrus orchards, and the quaint downtown area. We were immediately struck by the beauty of the town and the warmth of the people.
Our first order of business was to meet with our real estate agent, who had lined up several homes for us to view. We started with a beautiful ranch-style house on
the outskirts of town, which had an open floor plan and a sprawling backyard.
We loved the home, but it was a bit too remote for our liking.
Next, we visited a Spanish-style villa, which was situated in the heart of town. The
house had a lot of character and charm, with a tiled roof, arched doorways, and
a beautiful courtyard. We loved the location, but the house was a bit too small for our growing family.
We visited several more homes throughout the day, but none of them quite fit the bill. As the day came to a close, we decided to take a break and enjoy some of the local
attractions that Ojai had to offer.
We spent the next few days exploring the town, hiking in the mountains, and enjoying the delicious local cuisine. We visited the Ojai Valley Museum, which had a
fascinating collection of artifacts and exhibits about the town's history. We
also spent an afternoon at the Ojai Olive Oil Company, where we tasted some of the finest olive oils in the world.
As we enjoyed our break, we also began planning our wedding. We had booked a
beautiful venue in Malibu for our big day, but there were still many details to
sort out. We spent hours pouring over wedding magazines, choosing floral arrangements, selecting music, and deciding on the menu.
We also spent time reaching out to vendors and finalizing contracts. We hired a
fantastic photographer, a talented florist, and a DJ who would keep the dance floor packed all night long. We tasted cakes, and decided on a delicious red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting.
Planning a wedding can be stressful, but it was a relief to be able to focus on it during
our spring break. We felt productive and excited about our upcoming nuptials.
Towards the end of our break, we visited a few more houses, but none of them quite matched our dream home. We were beginning to feel discouraged and wondered if we would ever find the perfect house.
As we drove back to Los Angeles on the last day of our trip, we felt a sense of
disappointment that we had not found our dream home in Ojai. However, we also
felt grateful for the time we had spent together, exploring this beautiful town and planning our wedding.
A few days after we returned from our trip, our real estate agent called us with exciting news. A beautiful home had just come on the market in Ojai that she thought we would love. We immediately made an appointment to view the home.
As soon as we walked into the house, we knew it was the one. It had a spacious layout, a
large backyard with a swimming pool, and stunning views of the mountains. We
put in an offer, and to our delight, it was.
