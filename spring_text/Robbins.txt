Mateo had been an instructor at the university for over a decade. He loved teaching, but the long hours and constant stress of the job had taken a toll on him. Every year, when spring break rolled around, he promised himself that he would take some time off to recharge and rejuvenate, but somehow, he always found himself working through the break.
This year was different. Mateo was determined to take a break and do something that would bring him peace and joy. He had read about the superbloom at Carrizo Plains, and the idea of wandering through fields of wildflowers had captured his imagination. He packed his camping gear and set off for the plains, eager to experience the beauty of nature and escape the stress of his job.
As Mateo drove towards the plains, he could feel the tension in his body melting away. The rolling hills of California stretched out before him, and the vibrant green of the spring grasses was a soothing sight. When he arrived at the plains, he was struck by the sheer scale of the superbloom. The hills were awash with color, with carpets of wildflowers stretching out in every direction.
Mateo set up his tent at a campsite near the entrance to the plains and spent his first day wandering through the wildflowers. The scent of the flowers was intoxicating, and the warm sun on his face was a welcome change from the fluorescent lights of the classroom. As he walked, he felt a sense of wonder and joy that he hadn't experienced in years. He marveled at the intricacy of each flower, the way the petals formed perfect patterns, and the bees and butterflies that flitted from bloom to bloom.
As the sun began to set, Mateo returned to his campsite, feeling content and happy. He built a fire and cooked a simple meal of rice and beans, savoring the taste of each bite. As he ate, he thought about his life and his career. He realized that he had been neglecting his own needs, focusing so much on his work that he had forgotten to take care of himself. He promised himself that he would change that, that he would make time for the things that brought him joy and that he would remember to take breaks to recharge.
The next day, Mateo set off on a longer hike through the plains. He followed a trail that wound through the hills, taking him deeper into the heart of the wildflowers. As he walked, he felt a sense of connection to nature that he had never experienced before. He realized how small he was in the grand scheme of things, how insignificant his worries and stresses seemed in the face of the vastness of the natural world.
As he walked, he came across a small creek, its banks lined with yellow flowers. He sat down on a rock and dipped his feet in the water, feeling the coolness of the stream against his skin. He closed his eyes and listened to the sounds of the water and the birds singing in the trees. For a moment, he felt as though time had stopped, as though he was living in a perfect moment of peace and tranquility.
When he opened his eyes again, he saw a group of hikers approaching along the trail. They were a cheerful group of young people, laughing and joking as they walked. As they drew nearer, Mateo could see that they were all carrying plastic bags and picking up trash along the trail. He watched them for a moment, feeling a sense of admiration for their dedication to preserving the beauty of the wilderness.
When they reached his spot by the creek, one of the hikers, a young woman with bright red hair, greeted him with a smile. "Hi there," she said. "Enjoying the superbloom?"
Mateo smiled back. "Yes, it's
