As soon as the first day of spring break arrived, I was ready to kick off the week-long break with a bang. I was determined to make the most of my time off, so I planned an itinerary that would take me to some of the most beautiful and exciting spots in California.I began my journey in Balboa Island, where I met up with some friends to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. The festivities were wild and raucous, with people dancing in the streets, drinking Caipirinhas, and playing beach volleyball. I couldn't resist joining in on the fun and spent most of the day reveling in the festive atmosphere.After a few days of non-stop partying, I decided it was time to hit the road and make my way up north. My first stop was Berkeley, where I met up with my cousin and her family. They had planned an exciting day of sightseeing, and we spent the morning exploring the beautiful University of California Berkeley campus before heading over to San Francisco.I was in awe of the stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island. We explored the city's famous landmarks, like the Fisherman's Wharf, Ghirardelli Square, and the Painted Ladies. After a full day of adventure, we ended the night at a cozy restaurant in Sausalito, where I got to know my new employers over a delicious dinner.The next day, I headed back into San Francisco to visit a close friend who lives in the city. We went to Golden Gate Park and walked around the stunning Japanese Tea Garden. We stopped at a small coffee shop to catch up on old times and tried the city's famous sourdough bread. It was a perfect day spent with a great friend.My next stop was the North side of Highway 1, where I drove down the scenic route to Half Moon Bay. The drive was breathtaking, with endless ocean views and rugged cliffs. I stopped at a local seafood restaurant for lunch and indulged in fresh crab and clam chowder.As the day drew to a close, I made my way to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park to spend the night in a cute cabin nestled in the forest. I was surrounded by towering redwoods and the sounds of nature. The peace and quiet were a welcome respite from the noise and excitement of the past few days.The next morning, I woke up early to catch the waves at Santa Cruz. The water was cold, but the adrenaline rush of surfing was worth it. I spent a few hours out on the waves, catching as many as I could before making my way to the famous Monterey Bay Aquarium.I was blown away by the incredible variety of marine life on display at the aquarium. From jellyfish to sharks, there was so much to see and learn about. I spent hours exploring the exhibits, and before I knew it, it was time to head back home.As I made my way back home, I couldn't help but reflect on the incredible adventures I had over the past week. From St. Patrick's Day celebrations to surfing in Santa Cruz and exploring the wonders of Northern California, it was a spring break that I would never forget.
