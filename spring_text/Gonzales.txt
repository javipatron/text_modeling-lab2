As a graduate student, spring break was a much-needed respite from the hustle and bustle of school. I had been planning my trip to Vermont for months, excited to explore a new state and visit my friend who lived there with her dog. Little did I know that my spring break adventure would take some unexpected turns.


I arrived at JFK airport early in the morning, eager to catch my connecting flight to Vermont. However, as fate would have it, my first flight was delayed, causing me to miss my connecting flight. I was stranded in the airport, feeling frustrated and defeated. But I wasn't about to let a little setback ruin my trip.


After a few hours of waiting, I managed to secure a flight to Vermont for the following day. I spent the night in the airport, surrounded by the hum of travelers and the occasional announcement over the intercom. It wasn't the most glamorous start to my trip, but it gave me time to reflect and regroup.


The following day, I arrived in Vermont to a blanket of snow covering the landscape. My friend and her dog greeted me warmly, and we set out to explore the state. We went on hikes through the snowy mountains, taking in the breathtaking views of the surrounding forests and hillsides.


We also took road trips around the state, stopping at quaint little towns and local eateries. One of the highlights of our trip was a visit to a maple sugar farm, where we learned about the process of making maple syrup and sampled some of the farm's delicious products.


Despite the unexpected delay at the beginning of my trip, Vermont was everything I had hoped for and more. The crisp mountain air, the cozy cabin where we stayed, and the beautiful scenery all made for an unforgettable experience.


After a week in Vermont, I returned home for a day before jetting off to my next destination – Oahu. I was excited to visit three sisters who were friends of mine, all of whom had moved to the island years ago.


Upon arriving in Oahu, I was struck by the vibrant colors and lush vegetation that surrounded me. My friends greeted me with leis and hugs, eager to show me around the island. We went surfing, taking advantage of the island's world-famous waves. I was a bit rusty, but my friends patiently coached me, and soon I was riding the waves like a pro.


We also went on hikes through the island's lush rainforests, marveling at the towering trees and exotic flora. One of the highlights of the trip was a visit to a local food truck, where we sampled some of the island's best cuisine.


As my spring break adventure came to a close, I found myself feeling grateful for the unexpected twists and turns that had made it all the more memorable. From the snowy mountains of Vermont to the sun-drenched beaches of Oahu, I had experienced a range of adventures that had broadened my horizons and enriched my soul.


Looking back on my trip, I realized that it had taught me an important lesson – to embrace the unexpected and make the most of every situation. Life is full of surprises, and it's up to us to decide how we respond to them. I had chosen to make the most of my delays and setbacks, and in doing so, I had experienced a spring break adventure that I would never forget.
