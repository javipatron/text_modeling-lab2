Jillian Allison
Jillian had been looking forward to her spring break for weeks. The thought of spending a relaxing week at her parents' house in San Jose was just what she needed to recharge her batteries and prepare for the rest of her masters program.
When she arrived at her parents' house, Jillian was greeted with a warm hug from her mom and dad. After settling in, she wasted no time in getting comfortable. She spent the first few days of her break lounging on the couch with her boyfriend, Rohan, and binge-watching the entire Hunger Games trilogy. Despite Rohan's insistence that the movies were cinematic masterpieces, Jillian couldn't help but feel like the first movie was the only one worth watching.
In between movie marathons, Jillian spent time cooking up a storm in the kitchen. She had picked up some fresh tuna from Lunardi's, a local grocery store, and decided to try her hand at making homemade poke. The results were delicious, and Rohan couldn't get enough.
Despite the rain that persisted throughout the week, Jillian found plenty to keep herself busy. She spent an entire day cleaning out her childhood bedroom in preparation for her move back home at the end of the masters program in June. It was a bittersweet task, as she felt nostalgic for the memories of growing up in that room, but also excited for the new adventures that awaited her.
When Jillian needed a break from cleaning, she spent time with her dog, Bella. The little white poodle mix had been her faithful companion since she was a child, and Jillian loved nothing more than snuggling up with her furry friend on the couch.
As the week drew to a close, Jillian couldn't help but feel grateful for the time she had spent with her family and Rohan. Although the rainy weather had prevented her from getting out and exploring the city, she realized that the simple pleasures of spending time with loved ones, cooking delicious food, and cuddling with her dog were enough to make her feel content and happy.
As she packed her bags to head back to school, Jillian knew that she would carry the memories of her spring break with her for years to come. She felt ready to tackle the rest of the masters program with renewed energy and enthusiasm, knowing that she had taken the time to recharge her batteries and reconnect with the things that mattered most to her.
