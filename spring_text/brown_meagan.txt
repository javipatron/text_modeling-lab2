Meagan had been looking forward to spring break all semester. As a graduate student in UCSB's Master of Environmental Data Science program, she spent most of her days poring over spreadsheets and analyzing data. She was excited to have a break from the classroom and to explore a new place.

Meagan had decided to go to Oahu, Hawaii with four of her classmates: Dalila, Michael, Ruth, and Andre. They had rented a small Airbnb in Waikiki and planned to spend their days hiking, snorkeling, and trying all of the delicious food Hawaii had to offer.

Their first day on the island, they decided to hike to a nearby waterfall. The trail was lush and green, and the sound of rushing water could be heard in the distance. Meagan felt invigorated by the fresh air and the beauty of the landscape. As they hiked, they chatted about their classes and the research they were working on. Meagan was impressed by the passion and intelligence of her peers, and felt grateful to be part of such a supportive program.

When they arrived at the waterfall, they were struck by its beauty. The water cascaded down the rocks in a gentle mist, and a rainbow arced across the sky. Meagan felt a sense of wonder and peace as she gazed at the waterfall, and felt grateful for the opportunity to be in such a beautiful place with her friends.

The next day, they decided to go snorkeling. They rented snorkels and fins and headed to a nearby beach. Meagan had never been snorkeling before, but she was eager to try. As she swam through the crystal-clear water, she marveled at the colorful fish and the vibrant coral. She felt like she was in another world, surrounded by beauty and tranquility. She felt grateful for the chance to disconnect from her studies and to connect with nature.

That night, they went out to dinner and tried poke for the first time. Meagan was hesitant at first, as she wasn't a big fan of raw fish, but she was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was. The fish was fresh and tender, and the flavors of the marinade were complex and satisfying. They also tried a variety of other Hawaiian specialties, like loco moco and spam musubi. Meagan felt grateful for the chance to try new foods and to experience a different culture.

On their final day, they decided to hike to the top of Diamond Head. The trail was steep and rocky, but the view from the top was worth it. They could see the entire city of Honolulu spread out below them, and the ocean sparkled in the distance. Meagan felt a sense of accomplishment as she stood at the summit, and felt grateful for the opportunity to push herself physically and mentally.

As they flew back to California, Meagan felt a sense of gratitude for the trip. She had made new memories, tried new things, and bonded with her classmates in a way that wouldn't have been possible in the classroom. She felt refreshed and energized, ready to tackle the rest of the semester with renewed vigor. And she felt grateful for the beauty and diversity of the natural world, and for the chance to experience it firsthand.
