Gab was excited to be heading home to San Diego for Spring Break. She had just finished her first year at UC Santa Barbara, and she was looking forward to spending some quality time with her brother and his friends.
When Gab arrived in San Diego, her brother and his friends were waiting for her with open arms. They had planned a fun and wholesome week of activities, and Gab was excited to join in.
Their first stop was the beach. They spent the day lounging in the sun, playing spikeball, and jumping in the waves. Gab loved the feeling of the warm sand between her toes, and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore.
After a long day at the beach, they headed back to Gab's family's house for a home-cooked meal. Gab's mom had prepared a delicious spread of grilled chicken, corn on the cob, and fresh watermelon. They all sat around the table, laughing and catching up on each other's lives.
The next day, they headed to the golf course. Gab's brother and his friends were avid golfers, and they had arranged for a tee time at one of the top courses in San Diego. Gab had never played golf before, but she was excited to give it a try.
As they made their way around the course, Gab couldn't help but be impressed by the beautiful views and challenging holes. She struggled at first, but with some help from her brother and his friends, she started to get the hang of it.
That night, they headed to a local restaurant for happy hour margaritas. Gab's brother and his friends had picked out a spot with a great view of the sunset, and they toasted to a fun and memorable Spring Break.
The rest of the week was filled with more wholesome activities. They visited some of Gab's favorite spots in San Diego, like Balboa Park and the San Diego Zoo. They also made time to visit some of their relatives who lived in the area.
One day, they decided to take a hike in Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve. Gab had always loved hiking, and she was excited to show her brother and his friends one of her favorite trails. As they made their way up the trail, they took in the stunning views of the ocean and the cliffs. They stopped to rest at the top of the trail, and Gab felt a sense of peace and contentment wash over her.
As they made their way back down the trail, Gab's brother and his friends surprised her with a picnic lunch. They had packed sandwiches, fruit, and some of Gab's favorite snacks. They spread out a blanket on the grass, and they all sat together, enjoying the warm sun and the fresh air.
As the week came to a close, Gab couldn't help but feel grateful for the time she had spent with her brother and his friends. They had shown her a different side of San Diego, one that was filled with wholesome activities and quality time with loved ones.
On the last night of Spring Break, Gab and her brother and his friends sat around a campfire on the beach, roasting marshmallows and telling stories. Gab looked out at the ocean, feeling grateful for the memories they had made and the bonds they had strengthened.
As they said their goodbyes the next day, Gab hugged her brother and his friends tightly. She knew that they would always have these memories to look back on, and she felt grateful for the time they had spent together. Gab drove back to Santa Barbara with a full heart, feeling grateful for the wholesome Spring Break she had experienced in her home city of San Diego.
